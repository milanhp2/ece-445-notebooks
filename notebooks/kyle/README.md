Our group meet together to get the design document finished. When we divided the project into different subsytems it seems most likely I will be doing the power subsystem and helping out with the pcb creation. I will need to figure out how we will power the device and how much voltage/current.

My inital thoughts are that we use some batteries to power the device. The motors my teammates picked look like they will take 5V and sensors might be ok with 5V. Will need to test both though. Need to make the pack easy to access so we can replace batteries. Based on the picture that my team gave me I drew roughly where i'd want it to be.
