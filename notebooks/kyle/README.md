Our group meet together to get the design document finished. When we divided the project into different subsytems it seems most likely I will be doing the power subsystem and helping out with the pcb creation. I will need to figure out how we will power the device and how much voltage/current.

My inital thoughts are that we use some batteries to power the device. The motors my teammates picked look like they will take 5V and sensors might be ok with 5V. Will need to test both though. Need to make the pack easy to access so we can replace batteries. Based on the picture that my team gave me I drew roughly where i'd want it to be.

Machine shop agreed with a lot of design ideas except you suggested doing wall power or soemthing like that. The design would still stay similar to the original picture but depending on the weight we might need to move the power source to the side of the machine. This is because it currently might make the machine fall over but I still suggested having it close to the pcb.
