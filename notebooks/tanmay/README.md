The machine shop came back to us and showed us the finished project. They didn't include the the back box to cover all teh electronics yet. We asked for a redesign as the original position where we choose the temperature sensors wasent working.


I had trouble connecting my device esp32 from my laptop. I resolved this issue by manually hard resetting my esp32 by 
1) press on teh boot button an hold 
2) press the reset button while pressing the boot button
3) release the reset button
4) continue holding the boot button for a bit and then release.

this is used to remove error states that the esp32 sometimes gets stuch into. I also needed to manually download the device drivers like specific port drivers for the esp32 from the official driver website as when I downloaded the esp32 library drivers didn't automatically download. I needed to go to office hours to resolve this issue.


I was having trouble connecting my esp32 with the school wifi. The thing worked great with apartment wifi adn cellular hotspots but wouldn't connect to the university wifi.

I asked about this issue with the ta and he mentioned he'll ask other group members if they had similar problems. And the ta mentioned that the other groups are using Bluetooth connection rather than wifi. I looked into Bluetooth connection and the app created by the official esp32 company was not that well designed for ios devices. So I decided to continue researching about this and still used wifi connection.
