## ECE 445 Group 29 Notebooks
Our project for the Fall 2024 semester was to create an automated tea dispensing/monitoring device. This would track the temperature, humidity, and levels of dry tea leaves that users would store. 
They are able to monitor these levels using an app that runs off the ESP32 web server. They can also request specific weights of each tea blend to be dispensed. All they need to do is place a cup on 
the load sensor and hit the button to dispense tea leaves. Overall, this project allowed us to create a device that tea enjoyers could use to better store and dispense tea without needing to rely
on measuring spoons.
